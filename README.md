# Exmap

A **spreadsheet application** based on [maps](../../wiki/Maps) (key-values), instead of cells.   
Because of this the **integration** with other systems, with databases and with key-value stores becomes very easy.  
Its [web interface](../../wiki/UI%3A-Projects) allows [multiple users](../../wiki/Architecture) to edit the same spreadsheet in the same time.  

Please check the [documentation](../../wiki/Home) for a better overview.

It can be installed as a docker image from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aferrandi/exmap
